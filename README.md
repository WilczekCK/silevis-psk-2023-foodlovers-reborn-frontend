# Hackathon - Silevis/PŚk 2023
**3rd place in the tournament (during 24h event)**

**Distinction: The most beautiful app on event**
## Team: Foodlovers reborn 
Task: Create an app for a students, which will help with a signing up for a practices. App must simplify the way of delivering documents for the advisor.

**App was "finished" at 23:59:30 of maximal 24:00:00 time**

Main branch is not touched from the end of the event, to know what exactly I was able to do during that time.

### App requirements
1. Multilingual
2. Be a web app
3. Automatization of applying process

## So... the most important
All thanks to my co-workers, I see the progress that we made, just look at the past year project on the same event (repo is on my profile), we did a really good work - even if we did not took the first place. 

**You are just the best! :)**

Used technologies:
- React (React Cookies, React Router, React i18n)
- Axios
- Ant Design UI

So, what I did wrong in that project?
- Files do not keep the same labeling schema (usually its a camelCase, but sometimes its kebab-case)
- Overwriting CSS of the UI kit (Ant design)
- Copy&Paste of code instead of using custom hooks (tiredness)

**I already started to learn avoid this mistakes next time from now...**
